# week-14

I implemented the git workflow i currently use at work, with main, develop and feature branches.

Ideally every branch would have an id so we can connect it to jira and have tracking on the tickets

Due to time constraints i could not find a partner for this project, but i hope to in the next one :)

Usually whenn i mess up commits i leave the branch and create another one with a better name, and cherry pick from the old one.

I also erase the feature branches once they are in develop. But left them intact for the sake of the exercise
